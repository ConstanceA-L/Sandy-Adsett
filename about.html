                <p>Dr Sandy Adsett MNZM is a revered New Zealand artist and painter with experience in carving, weaving, costume and stage design. His immense career in Māori visual arts and education has seen him train many of Aotearoa&#39;s celebrated Māori artists, while his influence and artwork can be found across Aotearoa in meeting houses, churches, art museums, government and corporate venues and private collections.</p>
                <p>In the 1960&#39;s, he became an arts specialist for the Department of Education&#39;s Advisory Service, helping introduce the new Māori Arts in Schools program. In 1993, he was appointed principal tutor at Tairawhiti Polytechnic in Gisborne, formatting a wananga &#40;place of learning&#41; arts direction for Toihoukura School of Māori Visual Arts.</p>
